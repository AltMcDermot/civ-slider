This is a simple wordpress plugin for featured posts.

If you want the slideshow on your home page, then open Index.php file from “Dashboard” by clicking on Tab “Appearance / Editor” and paste the following piece of code at the suitable place.

if ( function_exists( 'show_slider' ) ) {
     show_slider(); }


When on any "edit post" page, just check the box next to "Check here to add post to homepage slider".

You can reorder the featured posts in the plugin option page under the settings tab.
